                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Marcus came to us as a 28-year-old recreational athlete who'd hit a frustrating plateau. He was training hard for amateur boxing competitions but couldn't break through to the next level. Despite spending hours in the gym, his speed, power, and endurance weren't improving. Worse, he was dealing with recurring shoulder pain that kept holding him back. Marcus knew he had the heart and determination, but he needed expert guidance to unlock his true potential.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Our Approach -->
            <div class="mb-16 fade-in">
                <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Our Approach</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We started with a comprehensive performance assessment to identify exactly what was limiting Marcus's progress. Our coaching team discovered imbalances in his training routine, gaps in his mobility work, and recovery habits that were actually working against him. We built a customized six-month program that combined sport-specific strength training, explosive power development, and strategic recovery protocols.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    But here's what made the real difference: our accountability system. Marcus had twice-weekly check-ins with his coach, weekly progress reviews, and a supportive training group that pushed him when motivation dipped. We didn't just hand him a workout plan—we stayed in the trenches with him every single week.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Marcus didn't just meet his goals—he exceeded them. Six months in, he stepped into the ring with a level of confidence and physical capability he'd never experienced before. He won his first amateur boxing competition and has since moved up a weight class to challenge himself further.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    But beyond the numbers and the victory, Marcus discovered something more valuable: a training system and support network that will serve him for life. As he told us after his win, "The accountability kept me honest, and the coaching made me believe I could do more than I thought possible."
