                <p>
                    I've been using AI to build this gym website—everything from the membership pages to the training descriptions. And I think I need to be upfront about that. Not because someone's making me, but because it's the right thing to do if I want people to trust my business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When AI writes a product description or helps me organize a pricing table, I'm not doing that work alone. If I pretend I did, that's dishonest. It's like taking credit for someone else's help, which doesn't sit right with me. Romans 13:7 says to give honor where honor is due. That includes being honest about who or what helped me create something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my business, this means adding a simple note at the bottom of pages saying "created with AI assistance." It's not complicated. I just say what AI helped with (like organizing content or creating tables) and what came from me (the actual prices, services, and business decisions). For example, AI didn't decide my membership should cost $20—I did. But AI helped me format that information in a clean table.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The real risk here is losing trust. If someone finds out I'm using AI and hiding it, they'll wonder what else I'm not being honest about. Can they trust my training advice? Is the nutrition guidance actually from me or just AI? In fitness, trust is everything. People need to believe their trainer knows what they're talking about and isn't just copying and pasting AI responses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My solution is simple: I only publish stuff I actually understand and could explain myself. If AI writes something about training that sounds smart but I can't back it up, I don't use it. And I keep a clear line between business operations (where AI helps with efficiency) and actual client conversations (where it's just me and my knowledge).
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the day, this website is a college project, but the principle matters for real business too. Be honest about your tools. Give credit where it's due. Don't pretend AI-written content is all you. It's just basic integrity.
